# traffic_crash_severity_prediction
A machine learning project that predicts fatal or serious traffic crashes using logistic regression. It applies preprocessing pipelines, SMOTE to handle class imbalance, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluates performance using the F1-score to balance detection of severe crashes and false alarms.
